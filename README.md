# Running StarkNet Nodes (very easy) v2

*With the release of Pathfinder 0.2.6-alpha, you do no longer need any additional plugins to build the docker image. The JSON-RPC forwarding works now too! I can only recommend using docker instead of building the node from source!*

*For background on StarkNet and Pathfinder check my original post: https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-run-a-starknet-node-very-easy-7937e3a7d942.*

### The Super Easy Setup
*Using Pathfinder and Watchtower to set up a self-updating StarkNet node.*

1. Clone my docker-compose file
    ```git clone https://github.com/0xytoken/pathfinder-docker.git```
2. Enter the repo and call docker-compose up.
    ```cd pathfinder-docker && docker-compose up```
3. If Pathfinder and Watchtower spin up beautifully, then stop them and run the command again but this time in detached mode (aka. background)
    ```docker-compose -d up```
4. If your Instancesâ€™ ports are open, then you can now query the nodesâ€™ status on port 9545 using the JSON-RPC endpoint.

Feel free to try it out yourself here.
